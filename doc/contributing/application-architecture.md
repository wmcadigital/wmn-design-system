        Any core SASS/SCSS that is used for styling components/patterns etc. should be placed in here and then referenced in `src/wmnds/assets/sass/wmnds.scss`. Note: Anything referenced will appear in the live build.

        - `components/`

          Examples of components usage in various contexts. See [README.md](../../src/components/README.md) in the components directory for more details. You can access these examples from [WMN Design System components](http://localhost:3000/components/).
