# Testing and linting

The CI lints SASS and JavaScript, and runs unit and functional tests with Node.

## Running all tests locally

To check the whole codebase, run:

```
npm test
```

This will trigger [standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) and [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) for linting, and [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for unit and functional tests.

See [Tasks](tasks.md) for details of what `npm test` does.

## SASS linting

See [CSS Coding Standards](coding-standards/css.md#linting) for details.

## Javascript linting

See [JavaScript Coding Standards](coding-standards/js.md#formatting-and-linting) for details.

## Unit and functional tests with Node.js

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), an automated testing platform with an assertion library, and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) that is used to control [headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome).

We test individual components and for instance global Sass files. See [all.test.js](../../src/tfwmds/all.test.js). for examples of global tests we run, and [checkboxes.test.js](../../src/tfwmds/components/checkboxes/checkboxes.test.js) for an example of component tests.

We aim to write the description of our tests in as "natural language" as possible, for instance "back-link component fails to render if the required fields are not included".

### Running individual tests

You can run a subset of the test suite that only tests components by running:

    `npm test -- src/tfwmds/components/button`

Note: There's a watch mode that keeps a testing session open waiting for changes that can be used with:

    `npm test -- --watch src/tfwmds/components/button`

### Updating component snapshots

[Snapshot tests](https://facebook.github.io/jest/doc/en/snapshot-testing.html) are used for preventing unintended changes - when the snapshot test runs, it compares the previously captured snapshot to the current markup. For components, the snapshots are stored in `[component-name directory]/_snapshots_`.

If a snapshot test fails, review the difference in the console. If the change is the correct change to make, run:

`npm test -- -u src/tfwmds/components/button`

This will update the snapshot file. Commit this file separately with a commit message that explains you're updating the snapshot file and an explanation of what caused the change.
