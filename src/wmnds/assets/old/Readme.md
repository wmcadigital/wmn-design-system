# Old assets

Don't delete anything in this folder as it is used to store compiled assets used by legacy links before we introduced versioning to the design system.

## When to delete?

This folder can deleted when all internal services point to the versioned links of the design system hosted on unpkg.
There is also a third-party platform (Swift) which use the legacy links (an example of the legacy CSS link that we still support: https://designsystem.wmnetwork.co.uk/css/wmnds-components.min.css).
