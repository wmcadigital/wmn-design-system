    <li>The label must appear directly above the field.</li>

  <h3>When not to use it?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use this component to ask more questions within a question - instead, ask a new question.</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>When not to use it?</h3>

    <li>When there are multiple questions on the same page, unless you have user research that says it makes sense to group the question?</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How it works?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Always test questions with users through user research</li>
    <li>Make sure your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/designing-good-questions">question makes sense</a></li>
    <li>Sometimes it makes sense to group a few questions on the same page</li>
    <li>Make sure users know why you're asking the question and only ask users for information you really need</li>
    <li>Add (optional) to the end of each question that is optional</li>

  <h2>Dropdown</h2>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Navigation expands when user hovers or clicks on it revealing options to select.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>When to use it?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When there is limited space and you need to reduce the space taken on the page</li>
    <li>When an input is nonessential, e.g. sorting list</li>
    <li>When you need flexibility because you do not know how many options there will be. All options are contained within the drop down component.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>When not to use it?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Drop down creates more work for your user because it is a multi-step process, they hide available options and they slow users down by defaults therefore if possible use another component to display options e.g. radio buttons, text field, input selector</li>
    <li>Do not use when drop down option has more than 36 characters because users will not be able to read them on some mobile devices</li>

  {# Handling error #}
  <h2 id="handling-errors">Handling errors</h2>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lets the user know what is wrong with their answer.</li>
    <li>Tells the user how to correct their answer.</li>
    <li>Tells the user what format or characters it is expecting.</li>
    <li>Prevents the user from trying to submit information that will be rejected by the API.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    When to use it?
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A handling error is used in addition to an error summary, which shows all errors on a page.</li>
    <li>When there has been an error with validating the user's answer after they try to continue to the next step.</li>
    <li>When the error is a validation error that is fixable.</li>
    <li>Use a separate error for each group of answer fields. For example, one error for date fields.</li>
    <li>The corrective action should be read by a screen reader before data entry components.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    When not to use it?
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not show the error until the user tries to move to the next step. Immediate validation can distract a user from progressing, especially if it validates as the user is typing.</li>
    <li>Hint text should help the user to understand how the field will be validated.</li>
    <li>If the service is down the user should be shown a service unavailable page.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    How to use it
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure questions and help text are well designed and tested with users to avoid errors in the first place.</li>
    <li>GOV.UK has advice to follow when <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/">writing error messages</a>.</li>
    <li>GOV.UK has advice for <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/validation/">helping users to recover from validation errors</a>.</li>
