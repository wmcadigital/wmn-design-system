{# About #}
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Buttons</strong> and <strong>links</strong> are items used to perform an action on a
  page
</p>
<p>
  It's important to know when to use a <strong>link</strong> or a
  <strong><a href="/components/buttons/">button</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Links</strong> should be used when a users action won’t affect the website at all,
  examples of these
  are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Certain call to actions</li>
  <li>Links to internal or external pages</li>
</ul>

<h3>What do the <strong>link</strong> attritubes mean?</h3>
<p>The <strong>href</strong> attritube is used to define the link address</p>
<p>The <strong>target</strong> attritube is used to define where to open the linked document.
  See below to find
  out more about the <strong>target</strong> attritube</p>
<p>The <strong>title</strong> attritube is used to define additional information about the
  link. It's useful for
  your users and accessibility. Try not to duplicate your link text- this hurts usability as
  hard of sight users
  using screen readers will here the same text twice.</p>

<p><strong>Target</strong> attritube values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>_blank</strong>: Will load clicked link in a new window</li>
  <li><strong>_self</strong>: Will load clicked link in the same frame as it was clicked in
  </li>
  <li><strong>_parent</strong>: Will load clicked link in the parent frameset</li>
  <li><strong>_top</strong>: Will load clicked link in the full body of the window</li>
  <li><strong>framename</strong>: Will load clicked link in a named frame</li>
</ul>

  <li>Do not use the back link on a content page.</li>
</ul>
{# How it works #}
<h3>How it works?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Always place back links at the top of the page.</li>
  <li>Make sure the link takes users to the previous page they were on, in the state they last saw it.</li>
  <li>If you cannot do this you should hide the back link. For example, when JavaScript is not available.</li>
</ul>
