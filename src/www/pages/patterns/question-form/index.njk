    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Asks a user questions which a service requires.</li>
        <li>Helps to break down complex forms by spreading questions across multiple pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When to use it?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you are asking users for information as part of a service.</li>
        <li>When a form is required to be spread across multiple pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When not to use it?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When there are multiple questions on the same page, unless you have user research that says it makes sense to group the questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How it works?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Always test questions with users through user research</li>
        <li>Make sure your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/designing-good-questions">question makes sense</a></li>
        <li>Sometimes it makes sense to group a few questions on the same page</li>
        <li>Make sure users know why you're asking the question and only ask users for information you really need</li>
        <li>Add (optional) to the end of each question that is optional</li>
    </ul>
