<h2>About</h2>
{# What #}
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The primary way of navigating the website</li>
  <li>Standardised pattern</li>
</ul>
{# When #}
<h3>When to use it?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Every page must have a header and a footer</li>
</ul>

{# Header #}
<h2>Header</h2>
{# Skip Link #}
<h3>Skip link</h3>
<p>There is a hidden skip link for users with screen reader assistive technology. This allows users to quickly access the main content. All pages must include this.</p>
<p>Ensure there is a HTML element on the page with the ID of <code class="wmnds-website-inline-code">wmnds-main-content</code> so the user can skip to this section.</p>
{# Logo #}
<h3>Logo</h3>
<p>This must always be the West Midlands Network logo.</p>
{# Phase indicator #}
<h3>Phase indicator</h3>
<p>This component must be used if the service is not live, using the phase indicator guidance.</p>
{# Navigation #}
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>The three top-level navigation items were decided by identifying our user’s top tasks using Gerry McGovern’s methodology. We overlaid a heatmap of the home page, where we found the same three areas were the most-used areas.</p>
<p>The top-level items open a structured megamenu to avoid cognitive overload. Users are familiar with this pattern from online shopping and transport operators.</p>
<p>We only use three top-level items as we prefer not to use hamburger menus on mobile. Users are required to make an extra click to reveal the navigation, therefore you cannot glance at navigation options.</p>
{# Mobile apps #}
<h3>Mobile apps</h3>
<p>When designing an app, you should use a tab bar and avoid using hamburger items wherever possible. Limit the tabs to the most important tasks using user research.</p>
{# Search #}
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>This functionality only shows for desktop and tablet users. When clicked, search expands and takes over the whole page.</p>

{# With title variant #}
<h3 id="title-header">With a title variant of header</h3>
<p>When developing a service you may not need the navigation of the main website. When this is the case, you can place the title of the service in the header (providing their is no other h1 element on the page).</p>

<p>To use the title variant:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add the h1 element and ensure it has the classes <code class="wmnds-website-inline-code">.wmnds-header__title .wmnds-col-1 .wmnds-col-sm-auto</code> on the element</li>
</ul>
