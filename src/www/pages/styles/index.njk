<p>Make your service look and feel like WMN Design System.</p>
<p>If you are using the WMN Design System Prototype Kit or have WMN Design System Frontend included in your build, the
  coded examples in the
  Design System will not need any additional styling.</p>
<p>If you need to apply styles manually, you should still follow existing WMN Design System conventions. For
  example, do not assign
  new meanings to colours, do not change the style of buttons or adjust the thickness of borders on
  form inputs.</p>
