{# Standard content template #}
<h2>Standard content template</h2>
{# What #}
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A template is based on 2/3 column for content and a 1/3 column right-hand side for widgets to publish functional content.</li>
    <li>Content editors will be able to use the design system components in Umbraco to structure content effectively and create visual hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
{# When #}
<h3>when to use it?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When you need to publish functional content based on a clear user task.</li>
    <li>When your content enables users to complete a specific task. For example, Get a refund, Update a Direct Debit, Find discount vouchers etc.</li>
</ul>
{# When not to #}
<h3>When not to use it?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When you need to create a page for a marketing campaign and you need to use promotional images.</li>
</ul>

{# Guidance #}
<h2>Guidance for content editors</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use a header image when there is a clear user need for the image and it serves a purpose. For example, on a 'Travel by tram' page, you may want to use a header image of a tram so users unfamiliar with the West Midlands Network will instantly know what our trams look like throughout the region.</li>
    <li>Use clear and concise content. For long content, there is a lower rate of readability and user comprehension drops significantly.</li>
    <li>Place content with higher importance at the top of the page, with less important content following after.</li>
    <li>
        If you need to place long content on a page, break it down into smaller sections to make it easier for the user to read. You can:
        <ul class="wmnds-m-t-sm">
            <li>Use content cards for important content which you want to draw attention to. You can use up to six content cards on a page. Do not use more than six as this will lose visual impact. When you have three tiles, it will span across the full-width layout.</li>
            <li>Use the accordion component to organise and group related information. Accordions can shorten pages and reduce scrolling when your content does not need to be read in full. We also recommend using accordions when space is at a premium and you are placing long content on a mobile interface or in a side panel.</li>
            <li>Use the Inset text component to highlight crucial information.</li>
            <li>Use the In-text step component to show a series of steps in a process.</li>
            <li>Place the Page contents component on the left side of a desktop page so users can skip to the relevant section without scrolling. This is especially useful for users on mobile, as the Page content component will be placed after the page title.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use links in your body content if you want to direct the user to additional content. Do not use buttons for any links.</li>
    <li>Only use buttons in your body content when a user needs to complete an action as part of a process, or if a user is confirming their details e.g. newsletter sign-up.</li>
</ul>
