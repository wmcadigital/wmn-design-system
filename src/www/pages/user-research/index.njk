    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>User research helps teams learn about users and create services that meet their needs.</p>
      <p>Without it, you won’t know what problems you’re trying to solve, what to build or if the service you create will work well for users.</p>
      <p>We're a team that's open to new tools and iterate our processes on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>The resources provided are intended as a starting point rather than a definitive guide.</p>
